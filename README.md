# ⭐ Booking & Payment Analytics Dashboard for Financial Reporting
This project delivers an end-to-end Booking & Payment Analytics Dashboard designed to provide finance and operational teams with real-time visibility into booking volumes, payment performance, and revenue trends.
The dashboard consolidates transactional data into a single analytical view, automating reporting processes and enabling faster business decision-making.

# 🚀 Project Overview
Traditional booking and payment analysis relied heavily on manual spreadsheets, resulting in delayed insights and inconsistent financial reporting.
This dashboard solves these issues by integrating SQL-based data extraction, structured data modeling, and automated visualization in Looker Studio.

The result:

- ✔ Centralized KPI monitoring
- ✔ Cleaner, validated transactional data
- ✔ Automated daily reporting
- ✔ Faster identification of anomalies and payment failures

    - **Description:** The goal of this project is to make a prediction model that will tell users the prices of their house if the user were to sell their house or property in Ibukota Nusantara (IKN).
    - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks use Random Forest, Light GBM, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Lasso Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression.
    - **Results:** A regression model that can predict the house prices of IKN and its surrounding area. The model chosen was XGBoost with the final result of 83% R2 accuracy–with the lowest error margin of about 5%.
    - **Deployment:** Check huggingface page to real experience [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xyncz/IKN-Price-Prediction)
